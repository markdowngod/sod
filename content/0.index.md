The best place to start your Season of Discovery.

#description
BlizzCon 2023 unveils an exciting addition to WoW Classic known as the Season of Discovery.
\
During this season, players will embark on a journey across Azeroth to uncover hidden secrets that will grant them class-altering abilities. Unusual combinations such as tanking Warlocks and Mage healers will become possible. The season kicks off with an [initial level cap set at 25](), and upon reaching this milestone, players will encounter a brand-new level-25 endgame experience. One of the highlights is the introduction of a 10-player raid in [Blackfathom Deeps](), featuring both new and reimagined bosses, mechanics, and rewards. Shortly thereafter, the level cap will be raised by a few levels, introducing additional endgame content for players to explore.
