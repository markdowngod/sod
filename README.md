Thank you so much for visting! We are still setting up and changing the way we display our data. Please feel free to drop a comment or suggestion via Github!


## Getting Started

Not sure where to start? Visit our rune pages and explore our rune engravings layout. By clicking the rune links you are taken to the varieties of discoveries for each rune. Each engraving is organized by faction/race/zone for ease of accessibility.


## Development

Our development process is discovery -> fact check -> implement into our database. As exciting it is to discover runes, locations and mobs may variey. We love taking discovery tips and passing them along to our other fellow adventurers.

## Server Side Rendering

We've deployed and streamlined our site to have as little lag as possible. Finding exactly what you need within seconds. Our goal is to provide the best rune-lookup experience; returning results in a clean, understandable, and quick fashion.


## Preview builds

Some feaures will be rolling out automatically, but we will do our best to record and announce changes.
